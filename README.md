# csgohack
An external csgohack written in java

Mainly a proof of concept of the possibility of csgo hacks in Java. This automatically updates offsets from https://github.com/frk1/hazedumper (Thanks frk1).

Managed to get bunny hop to work, except that I couldnt correctly fetch onground status so its kinda buggy and doesnt work properly. I kinda gave up after that. Feel free to use it as a base and expand upon it, and also feel free to submit PRs.
